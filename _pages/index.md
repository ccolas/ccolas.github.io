Hi! I'm CÃ©dric Colas, AI researcher exploring open-ended learning and computational creativity.

<br>

### Research Interests


I'm interested in the study of **artificial open-ended skill discovery** --- how an artificial agent can continuously grow a repertoire of skills throughout its lifetime. This interest led me to focus on **intrinsically motivated agents** that set their own goals, also known as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09830" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autotelic agents</a>.

I believe that for agents to develop such open-ended capabilities, they must be embedded in **rich socio-cultural environments** --- interacting with peers, engaging with humans, and participating in a shared process of cultural evolution. We explore this idea further in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01134.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perspective article</a>.

I completed my PhD at the <a href="https://flowers.inria.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flowers Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://www.pyoudeyer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pierre-Yves Oudeyer</a> and <a href="https://www.isir.upmc.fr/personnel/sigaud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivier Sigaud</a>. My thesis, <strong>Towards Vygotskian Autotelic Agents: Learning Skills with Goals, Language and Intrinsically Motivated Deep Reinforcement Learning</strong>, is available <a href="/data/cedric_colas_manuscript.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4vS557rhAM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defense video</a>).

I'm currently working at MIT with <a href="https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/people/joshua-tenenbaum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua Tenenbaum</a> and <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~jda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jacob Andreas</a>, developing autotelic agents that learn from humans and others using <strong>program synthesis</strong> methods.

### Artistic explorations

Beyond my research, I explore creative applications of algorithms through various side projects.  
See some of these explorations <a href="/project/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  >here</a>.
