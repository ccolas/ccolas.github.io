I'm Cédric Colas, AI researcher and bricoleur.

#### Research

I work at Inria and MIT on artificial curiosity and open-ended learning. My research started with curiosity-driven reinforcement learning agents that set their own goals (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09830" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autotelic agents</a>), and has grown into questions about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">language as a cognitive tool for agents</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00074" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social learning in hybrid human-AI populations</a>, and how cultural dynamics might sustain open-ended innovation. More recently, I've been working on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14172" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LLM-guided program synthesis</a> and <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v232/colas23a/colas23a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LLM-based agents</a> that learn to code and reason. I did my PhD at Inria's Flowers Lab, where I studied <a href="/data/cedric_colas_manuscript.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">language-guided autotelic agents</a>.

#### Art

The rest of the time, I make things. I've built a <a href="/project/pianocktail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pianocktail</a> that translates piano music into cocktail recipes, a <a href="/project/chit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thermal-printer spirit</a> with its own inner life, and an <a href="/project/tangible-dreams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interactive installation</a> where visitors rewire neural networks by hand. I make <a href="/project/dirty-mixer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dirty video mixers</a>, generate <a href="/project/charabia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imaginary French words</a>, map <a href="/project/chromatic-cartography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">geography to color</a>, and <a href="/project/cppnworld" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breed visual universes</a> through artificial evolution. I also shoot <a href="/photographs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">film photography</a>.
