Hi! I'm CÃ©dric Colas, AI researcher and digital artist. 

#### Research

I've obtained my PhD at the [Flowers Lab](https://flowers.inria.fr/) under the supervision of [Pierre-Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/) and [Olivier Sigaud](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/personnel/sigaud/). 

The title is: **Towards Vygotskian Autotelic Agents: Learning Skills with Goals, Language and Intrinsically Motivated Deep Reinforcement Learning** (<a 
href="/data/cedric_colas_manuscript.pdf" download>manuscript</a>, [defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4vS557rhAM)). In short, I'm interested in the study of _artificial 
open-ended skill discovery_, the ability for an artificial agent to grow an open-ended repertoire of skills along its life. This leads me to focus on intrinsically motivated 
agents that sets their own goals, a.k.a. [_autotelic agents_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09830). 

I'm also convinced that to develop such abilities, agents will need to be immersed into rich socio-cultural worlds, to interact with their peers and with humans, to participate 
in a shared cultural evolution, with us. This idea is developed in our recent perspective article.

I'm currently working with [Joshua Tenenbaum](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/people/joshua-tenenbaum/) at MIT, where I look into how _program synthesis_ methods could help 
intrinsically motivated agents to grow open-ended repertoires of skills in partnership with humans. 

#### Art

I often think of ways to reuse the algorithms I encounter in my research for alternative, _mostly useless_ purposes. This leads to the projects presented <a href="/">here</a>.
