<b>Hi! I'm CÃ©dric Colas, AI researcher and digital tinkerer.</b>
</p>

#### Research Interests
I'm interested in the study of _artificial open-ended skill discovery_, the ability for an artificial agent to grow an open-ended repertoire of skills along its life. This led me to focus on intrinsically motivated agents that set their own goals, [_autotelic agents_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09830). 

I'm also convinced that to develop such abilities, agents will need to be immersed into rich socio-cultural worlds, to interact with their peers and with humans, to participate in a shared cultural evolution, with us. This idea is developed in our [perspective article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01134.pdf).

I've obtained my PhD at the [Flowers Lab](https://flowers.inria.fr/) under the supervision of [Pierre-Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/) and [Olivier Sigaud](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/personnel/sigaud/). The title of the thesis is **Towards Vygotskian Autotelic Agents: Learning Skills with Goals, Language and Intrinsically Motivated Deep Reinforcement Learning** (<a href="/data/cedric_colas_manuscript.pdf" download>manuscript</a>, [defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4vS557rhAM)). 

I'm currently working with [Joshua Tenenbaum](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/people/joshua-tenenbaum/) and [Jacob Andreas](https://www.mit.edu/~jda/) at MIT, where I develop autotelic agents able to learn from humans and others using _program synthesis_ methods.

#### Tinkering

I often think of ways to reuse the algorithms I encounter in my research for alternative _mostly useless_ purposes. This leads to the projects presented <a href="/project/index.html">here</a>.
