I built a piece of code to generate imaginary French words. The idea is simple: 

<ol>
    <li> Take a corpus of French words;  </li>
    <li> compute the transition statistics conditioned on the last N characters;  </li>
    <li> sample from that transition matrix.   </li>
</ol>

I used a database of French books and movies subtitle available [here](http://www.lexique.org/) (142,362 words).

The only parameter is N. As N increases, the generation becomes more constrained; words start to sound more French, but a higher proportion of them end up being existing 
French words.

We can start to find French sounding words from N=3: sairions, bouvirents, talpottes, musiant, plamusse.

At N=5, about half of the words are actual French words, but the rest is imagined: paraignes, lamistes, embalisme, racinations, paraphie, fallotaient, amarcoussiens.

Find larger lists of words for [N=3](/data/post/charabia/seq3.txt), [N=4](/data/post/charabia/seq4.txt), and [N=5](/data/post/charabia/seq5.txt).

The [code](https://github.com/ccolas/charabia) can be easily extended to other languages provided that you have a dataset of words from that language (the code's readme lists 
the steps).
