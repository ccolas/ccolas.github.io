Photography has two ways of capturing more light: opening the diaphragm wider, or keeping the shutter open longer. Keeping the shutter open creates images that are the superposition of everything the camera saw; capturing patterns and movements we could not have perceived directly. 

Most of these shots were taken using the darkest settings available on my phone --- minimum ISO, smallest aperture, and a shutter speed that balances capturing movement without overexposing the image (typically between 1/8 and 1/2 secs). Some images feature an additional element: diffracting paper that creates rainbow-like effects by splitting light into its spectrum of colors.
