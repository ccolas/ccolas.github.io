Your goal is to survive as long as possible. Be careful: orange, brown, and pink objects will kill you on contact, so keep an eye on them - orange will even chase you!

The BROWN And PINK tiles will behave the same way throughout, but the ORANGE tile seems to be like a slow homing missile because it freely moves, and it will move in the same direction you are going. Where you go doesn't matter, try to stay within the big open areas but when the ORANGE tile is closing in on you, you need to move because you don't want to get trapped. You lose by being touched by the BROWN, PINK and ORANGE tiles and you win by surviving after a certain amount of time.", "Human #2": "Avoid any moving blocks. Don't touch anything.

Orange will slowly follow Darkblue for the entire round. Lightblue and Lightgreen will be shooting Brown and Pink across the screen. Warning: Running Darkblue into any of these colors other than Lightblue will result in a loss of life. Move Darkblue slowly around the open areas and avoid Orange for as long as possible.

You must work to avoid them", "Human #11": "I believe that you have to move your blue square with the arrows to try and get to the other end of the board without touching the brown and orange squares.

Avoid orange, pink, and brown for as long as possible.", "Human #19": "This game is a mix of tag and frogger. You have to stay away from every other block on the board and one is chasing you. My strategy was go all the way to the top corner closest to the side I was on first then as the chasing block got closer I would rapidly move to the other side using my arrow keys. I did notice that the chaser gets faster and at times I had to wait for an opening to go to the bottom and wait till the chaser got close again before moving to the other side. A tip would be do not go all the way in the corner after the initial time or you may not have an opening.", "Human #20": "At this stage, just focus on avoiding contact with anything.
